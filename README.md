# Recommended Software Stack
## MKRhere/r/

Hello, I'm Muthu Kumar.

I work on a lot of stuff, mostly in design and code, but I also write articles and stories, make films and stuff. Due to my varied interests, I think it's worth putting out my recommended software for anyone to find use in it. Hence I made the `/r/` repository. If you were looking for something, this might help you. Also, if you are violently fuming out there over my choice, feel free to `issue` your frustration out. We're here to learn.

> Note: I personally use these software. Most are open source, cross platform, and preferably have a portable option. Some might be unconventional or unpopular choices, but it works for my requirements. It might or might not work for you. Categories are alphabetically sorted, and lists are prioritized primary first.

> Legend:

> ❇️ Free as in air.

> ⚠️ Free, but not open source.

> ❌ Not free, not open source.

> 🚫 Used to use, now no more. Will remove from list soon.

### Architectural drafting & modeling

- ❌ **Autodesk AutoCAD** (2D)—there's simply no reasonably good option for a good 2D drafting software like AutoCAD.
- ❌ **Trimble SketchUp** (3D)—not free, not the best, but can get a lot of very good work done. Never felt the need to upgrade to something like 3DS Max or Blender.

### Architectural rendering

- ❌ **iRender for SketchUp** works better for my personal style of textureless rendering.
- ❌ **Vray for SketchUp**—if you know how to, this plugin will help you make breathtaking, photorealistic renders.

### IDE

- ❇️ **Visual Studio Code**—free, open source, cross platform; developed by Microsoft; the only IDE I've ever needed since I shifted over.
- ⚠️ **CodePen.io** (Web)—when you need to collaborate with someone online.

### Messaging

- ❇️ **Telegram**—open source, cross platform, supports some Markdown and code formatting; vibrant and active developer community.

### Operating System

- ❌ **Microsoft Windows**: Oh yes, so much for open source. Bring the hate on. But as you can probably notice, some of the software I'm used to are only available on Windows. I'm gradually replacing some of my dependencies to open source where possible, but I'm not Richard Stallman.
- ❇️ **Ubuntu Server**:  All my servers start as Ubuntu. I think the community alone is a good reason.
- ❇️ **Kubuntu**: Some times, I like to have an environment similar to my servers but Gnome DE is absolute misery. Hence, KDE on Ubuntu.

### Programming Languages

- ❇️ **HTML/CSS**
- ❇️ **Sass**—The indented syntax. Life is so much easier.
- ❇️ **Node JS**, of course.
- ❇️ **Python**, occasionally. Not experienced.

### Photo Editor

- ❌ **Adobe Photoshop**

### SASS

- ❇️ **sass cli** - Well, nothing beats the good ol' cli.
- ~🚫 ❇️ **Scout App**—it just works. Add a project and scout will automatically find existing SASS and compiled CSS files.~

### Vector Design

- ⚠️ **Gravit Designer**—free, cross-platform (not open source though), simple and powerful vector design software.
- ❌ **Adobe Illustrator**—not free, not available for Linux, but still the leader out there.

### Video Editing

- ❌ **Sony Vegas Pro**—not free, not the best editing software out there, but if you can improvise, can be very powerful for your workflow.

### Web Browser

- ❇️ **Firefox Developer Edition**—use this for web development. Grid inspector, visual CSS animation editor are great additions.
- ~🚫 ⚠️ **Opera Browser** for general browsing—offers a suite of features like free VPN, built-in ad blocking, data saving, Opera CDN, etc. Do not try to use this for development.~
