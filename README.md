# MKRhere/r My Recommended Software Stack

Hello, I'm Muthu Kumar.

I work on a lot of stuff, mostly in design and code, but I also write articles and stories, make films and stuff.

### Operating System

- ❇️ **Debian GNU/Linux**: Debian is my powerhouse, running on my workstation. I have a very minimal i3-gaps setup.
- 🛑 **Microsoft Windows**: ~~Since I work in design and video production, many of my tools are available only on Windows.~~ This is no longer true since DaVinci Resolve is on Linux and Figma/Penpot are on the web, but I still have Windows on my laptop, "just in case".
- ❇️ **Ubuntu Server**:  My server has been running Ubuntu for quite a long time. I should probably migrate to Debian soon.

### Web Browser

- ❇️ **Firefox Developer Edition**: use this for web development. Grid inspector, visual CSS animation editor are great additions.

### IDE

- ❇️ **Visual Studio Code**: free, open source, cross platform; developed by Microsoft; the only IDE I've ever needed since I shifted over.

### Messaging

I am on WhatsApp and other platforms for connectivity, but you'll find me mostly on:

- ❇️ **[Telegram](https://telegram.org)**: open source, cross platform, supports some Markdown and code formatting; vibrant and active developer community.

### Programming Languages, frameworks & platforms

- ❇️ **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)**
- ❇️ **HTML/CSS**
- ❇️ **[Zig](https://ziglang.org)** ⚡️

### Runtimes

- ❇️ **Node**
- ❇️ **Deno**
- ❇️ **Bun**

### Preferred databases
- ❇️ **MongoDB**
- ❇️ **Postgres**
- ❇️ **MariaDB**

### Photo Editor

- ⚠️ **[Photopea](https://www.photopea.com)**: Free online editor with somewhat similar toolset to Adobe Photoshop
- 🛑 **[Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo)**: Another competitor to Adobe Photoshop
- 🚫 **Adobe Photoshop**

### Vector Design

- 🛑 **[Figma](https://www.figma.com)**: Figma is currently my go-to for UI/UX design.
- ❇️ **[Penpot](https://penpot.app)**: Figma is going to the dogs, and Penpot is looking more and more attractive.

### Video Editing

- ⚠️ **[DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/in/products/davinciresolve)**: <u>THIS</u> is _FREE_?! Why exactly do people pay for Premiere?
- 🛑 ~~**Adobe Premiere Pro**: I've switched to Premiere this year, and it's an amazing experience. I no longer have to improvise for features that it provides out of the box.~~
- 🚫 ~~**Sony Vegas Pro**: not free, not the best editing software out there, but if you can improvise, can be very powerful for your workflow.~~


### Architectural drafting & modeling

Archaic section. I haven't worked in architecture in a long time.

- 🛑 **Autodesk AutoCAD**: (2D)—there's simply no reasonably good option for a good 2D drafting software like AutoCAD.
- 🛑 **Trimble SketchUp**: (3D)—not free, not the best, but can get a lot of very good work done. Never felt the need to upgrade to something like 3DS Max or Blender.

### Architectural rendering

Archaic section. I haven't worked in architecture in a long time.

- 🛑 **iRender for SketchUp**: works better for my personal style of textureless rendering.
- 🛑 **Vray for SketchUp**: if you know how to, this plugin will help you make breathtaking, photorealistic renders.
