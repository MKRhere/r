# Recommended Software Stack MKRhere/r/

Hello, I'm Muthu Kumar (MKR). I work on a lot of stuff, generally in design and code, but I also write articles and stories, make films and stuff. Due to my varied interests, I think it's worth putting out my recommended software for anyone to find use in it. If you were looking for something, this might help you. Also, if you are violently fuming out there over my choice, feel free to comment your frustration out. We're here to learn.

> Note: I personally use these software. Most are open source, cross platform, and preferably have a portable option. Some might be unconventional, but it works for me on my underpowered system. It might or might not work for you.
